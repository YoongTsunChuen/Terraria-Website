	<td><p>I absolutely love this game to death, and I love the effort put into each update. If you love sandbox and/or survival games, especially Minecraft, I'd recommend you give this game a shot. Plenty of content to unpack once you get in game, and they just keep adding to it!!</p>

	<td><p>There are so many things to love about this game. Similar to Minecraft, you can choose how you want to play and let your creativity run wild. Unlike Minecraft, this game feels purposeful and has an incredibly fun and well designed fighting/battling component. I bought this over 10 years ago and every time I pick it back up, I fall in love all over again. Everything about this game is charming. From the music, pixel style, Easter eggs and jokes, and countless hours of fun and adventure. Best $9.99 I ever spent!</p>

	<td><p>Game is really fun but expect pain and suffering if you want to play on higher difficulties. Also get these 3 mods at all costs Fargo's mutant mod, recipe browser and magic storage while it will take abit to change their settings into what you want it is worth it trust me.</p>
